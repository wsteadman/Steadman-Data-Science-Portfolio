# Project Overview: 
This project is desgined to showcase cleaning & visualizing a flawed dataset in Python! 

## Instructions: 
- Pip install pandas 
- Import the 2008 Olympic Medalist dataset
- Run the Jypter notebook cells in order, first reshaping the dataset:
    - Each variable is in its own column
    - Each observation forms its own row
    - Each type of observational unit forms its own table

- Create visualizations by running Jypter notebook cells:
    - barchart showing total numbers of each medal 
    - barchart comparing total number of men's to women's sports 
    - horizontal barchart showing number of medals for each sport 

## Dataset Description: 
- Contains 2008 olympic medal winners 
- Sourced from a CSV given by professor 
   - Flawed in that each athlete is cross referenced with every event
