# Project: Cleaning and Visualizing 2008 Olympics Medal Data 

## ‚ú®Overview

This project demonstrates the process of cleaning a "flawed" or "untidy" dataset and performing exploratory data analysis using Python's Pandas library. The primary goal is to transform the data into a tidy format better suited for analysis and then generate visualizations to explore the data.

## üèÖDataset

* **Source:** CSV file provided by a professor (`olympics_08_medalists.csv`).
* **Content:** Lists medalists from the 2008 Olympic Games.
* **Challenge:** The original dataset is structured in a "wide" format where ever athlete forms a row and is cross-referenced with every sport/event column, making analysis difficult. This format causes numerous empty cells. The sex of the atheltes and their events are also combined, even though these features represent distinct data points.

## üîçProcess

The analysis follows these key steps implemented in the Jupyter Notebook:

1.  **Import Data:** Load the initial CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Data Tidying (Reshaping):**
    * Use the `pandas.melt` function to transform the DataFrame from a wide format to a long format. This consolidates the multiple sport/event columns into two new columns: one for the sport/event category and one for the medal type (Gold, Silver, Bronze).
    * Remove rows with missing medal values (`NaN`)
    * Split the combined sport/event column into separate 'Sex' and 'Sport' columns.
    * Drop the original combined column.
3.  **Data Visualization:**
    * Create bar charts to visualize:
        * Total count of each medal type (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
        * Total count of medals won by male vs. female athletes
        * A horizontal bar chart showing the number of Gold medals per sport
        * Generate a pivot table to summarize the number of medals (Gold, Silver, Bronze) won by athletes, broken down by both Sport and Sex.

## üìã Instructions
* Clone this repository
* Pip install pandas
* Open the `Olympians.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
* Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom to execute the data loading, cleaning, visualization, and analysis steps!
