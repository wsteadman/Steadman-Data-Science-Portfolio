# Steadman-Data Science Portfolio

This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic and self-learning purposes.

First Streamlit App
---
This project demonstrates the process of importing a dataset and creating a web application using Streamlit.

- Project Description: In this project, I worked with a dataset of Penguins and built an interactive web application that allows users to explore and visualize the data sournding the penguins fliiper lengths in a dynamic way.

Tidy Data Project
---
This project focuses on cleaning unstructured data and transforming it into a tidy format suitable for analysis.

- Project Description: In this project, I worked with raw, messy data about Olympians and applied data wrangling techniques to clean it. After cleaning, I visualized key insights from the dataset.
