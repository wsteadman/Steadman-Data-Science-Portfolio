# Steadman-Data Science Portfolio

**This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic and self-learning purposes!**

## First Streamlit App 
---
- **Project Description**: This project demonstrates the process of importing a dataset and creating a basic web application using Streamlit! In this project, I worked with a dataset of Penguins and built an interactive web application that allows users to explore and visualize the data surounding the penguins fliiper lengths in a dynamic and interactive way!

- **Application**: Useful for interacting with datasets to communicate easy to understand and simple insights through streamlit!

- **Take Aways**:
  - Gained hands-on experience using Streamlit to build and deploy data applications
  - Practiced data visualization and filtering techniques in a web-based interface

## Tidy Data Project
---
- **Project Description**: This project is built in a Juypter Notebook, and focuses on cleaning unstructured data and transforming it into a tidy format suitable for analysis. In the project, I worked with raw, messy data detailing aspects of Olympians, and applied data wrangling techniques to make it useable. After cleaning, I visualized key insights from the dataset and displayed them

- **Application**: Useful for understanding how to reshape datsets so that they are easier to manipulate and understand for further analysis

- **Take Aways**:
  - Data cleaning and transformation using Pandas, and explained using markdown (identifying and handling missing, inconsistent, and duplicated data)

### Machine Learning Application Project
- **Project Description**: This is a machine learning classification app that allows users to build, visualize, and evaluate machine learning classification models in streamlit. Built with Streamlit and scikit-learn, this tool makes powerful classification algorithms, visuals, and metrics accessible to users of all technical backgrounds who can upload their own data or choose a demo dataset!

- **Application**: This tool allows users to upload their own datasets or choose from demo datasets to gain meaningful insights that would typically require significant background work. Users can also change model parameters, like descion tree depth or scaling data to see how these aspects affect results!

- **Take Aways**:
  - Implemented a framework to switch between different algorithms (Decision Trees vs. Logistic Regression) and allowed users to edit some of these models' inputs/parameters, showing how these decisions can affect the strength of a model
  - The app also automatically handles data preprocessing, demonstrating how essential this aspect of model building is to a useable model
